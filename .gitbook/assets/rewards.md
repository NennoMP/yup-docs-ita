# Rewards

## How to make money

Users can make money by receiving YUP tokens as rewards for rating.

### The Process

The Yup [protocol](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/protocol.md) determines the monetary value of each vote based on each voter's [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence). For example, if 100 [YUP](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/token.md) is being distributed in 1 hour and your rating’s influence makes up 5% of all rating influence in that 1 hour, your rating is worth 5 YUP. Yup then rewards that money to all previous users who rated the same as you AND rewards the creator of the content.

1. You give your opinion by rating content on a scale of 1-5.
2. Someone else gives that same opinion for the same content.
3. You get paid a portion of the monetary value of their rating.
4. And so on! The more ratings after you, the more you earn.

### Vote Value - What is your opinion worth?

~50% is given to creators \(if one exists\) and the rest is split between previous raters based on their relative influence.

### Not all votes get rewards

Your own opinion doesn’t simply make you money because you expressed it. It’s only worth something if others agree. If nobody rates the same as you, it means you’re either late on that opinion or it’s an unpopular opinion, so you won’t earn rewards for that rating.

### More influence more money

Your [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence) \(IN\) is a measure of your social value on Yup. Currently, it’s mostly a measure of your YUP token holdings and rewards you’ve previously received. However, at launch of the full Yup Protocol, there will be additional factors that affect your influence.
