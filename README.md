# Yup

## Overview
Yup is a network that rewards you for good opinions. By doing so, it creates a social consensus layer for the internet, accurately representing the agreed-upon social value of anything, from random Tweets to your history professor. It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it. \([Learn More](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/protocol.md)\)

The best way to use Yup is through the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to vote on any site or piece of content across the web. It also stores your money and displays the social value of everything in a color coded scheme. \([Learn More](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/ext.md)\)
